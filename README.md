# Analysis-of-Flight-Data
The project uses data about flight arrivals and delays from the US Department of Transportation to do exploratory data analysis using Python. Additionally, statistical analysis using ANOVA and Tukey's HSD test is carried out to deduce if there are significant differences in the delay times at each airport.


### Visualization of Data using PowerBI

The graphs are created using python libraries, and a seperate dashboard is created using PowerBI.
