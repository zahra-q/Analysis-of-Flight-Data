# Visualization of Data using PowerBI
The project uses data about flight arrivals and delays from the US Department of Transportation.

### Data Preparation/Cleaning 

Since this data was not very suitable for data analysis, we had to change the format of some of the data in the dataset. This entailed:

1. Removing duplicate rows
2. Removing null columns
3. Removing missing values
4. Converting data types

### Exploratory Data Analysis 

Since every data analysis project should start with a set of questions and an objective, these were the questions we wanted to answer:
1. What were the major reasons for flight delays in the US?
2. Which were the top airports with maximum delays?
3. On a yearly basis, how many flights get delayed for each airline in our dataset?
4. Which months have the most weather delays?
5. Which airports get the most amount of arrivals?
